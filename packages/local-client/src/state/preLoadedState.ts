You can write JavaScript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using Markdown.\n- Click any text cell (including this one) to edit it\n- The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell!\n- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the \`show\`function. This is a function built into this environment. Call show multiple times to show multiple values\n- Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right\n- Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell\nAll of your changes get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran \`npx jbook serve test.js\`, all of the text and code you write will be saved to \`test.js\` file in the same folder where the command is executed.
